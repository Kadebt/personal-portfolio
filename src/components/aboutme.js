        Hi! I'm Kade Thompson a Full Stack Web Developer currently living in
        Salt Lake City, Utah. I graduated from Dev Mountain in July of 2020.
        After some unfortunate circumstances I had to take a construction job
        and was stuck in that line of work for the last 2 years. Good news
        though I am developing again! I am currently looking for work and have
        just finished my first major project after my 2 year break. I am looking
        to land my first dev job to start my career in the tech industry!{" "}
